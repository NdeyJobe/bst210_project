data_wrangling.qmd: This is the data wrangling code that cleaned the raw data set we downloaded from worldbank data center. It is written such that our data set is reproduciable, meaning, once you download the raw data set, each time you run the code on it, you will end up with the exact cleaned data set-- amended column names, new variables, partitioned data set, etc we will be using for our final analysis.

source.qmd: This is the file that contains the negative binomial model and all other models we will include in our final paper.

achieve: every other work that was done in the exploration stage.
